          <h3>Hi,</h3>
          <p>This is Bablu Ahmed from Dhaka, Bangladesh. I am a computer programmer and blogger or w3 public. I am the
            founder and editor of w3public.com. Currently, I am working as a software engineer in my country. I like to
            learn new technologies and implement them as practice. And finally, I post it on the blog as a tutorial for
            the
            w3 public.
          </p>
          <p>
            As you know programming is a challenging job that's why I try to write computer code in terms of practice
            almost
            everyday to prove myself again and again to everyone. I am not so perfect in my profession but try my best.
            I
            daily promise myself to work hard and love everything related to programming.
          </p>

          <p>
            I always think to work for my country as well as for the new generation who are facing the programming
            related
            issues and I also think to improve their programming skills. Right now, my challenge is to make a web-based
            software platform that will support and connect the public to the updated technologies. Hope we will
            together
            build a new milestone soon.
          </p>
